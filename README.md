# PythonForRUsers
Notebooks to introduce R users to Python

*NOTE*: This is a work in progress!

The ultimate aim is to generate a set of notebooks to help introduce R users to Python for data analysis. Here is the tentative plan:

1. Variables
2. Control structures
3. Numerical operations with Numpy
4. Data analysis using Pandas
5. Linear algebra and statistical modeling
